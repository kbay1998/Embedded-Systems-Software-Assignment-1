Project title: Embedded Systems Software and Development Environment Week One Assignment

Instructions:You are to write a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, you will need to reorder this data set from large to small. All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, you will need to print that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation. You will need to submit a version controlled repository of these 3 files.

 stats.c - Implementation file for your C-programming code

 stats.h -  Header file for your C-programming code

 README.md -  Includes information on the author and the project

 Undertaking of Project:
 I developed eight functions in c programming:void main, int print_array, int sort_array, float mean, float median, int find_maximum
 int find_minimum, int print_statistics that sorts a 40 element array in ascending order of magnitude, prints the array computes the
  mean, median,maximum and minimum value of the array.
